# Data Conflict (Hazard)
# "read after write (RAW)" or "true dependency":
# An instruction modifies a register or memory location, 
# and a succeeding instruction reads the data in that memory or register location.
# A data hazard occurs if the read takes place before the write operation is complete.

# Example:

.data
x:      .word 5

.text
start:
li      t1, 0x10000000		# t1 = address of x
li      t2, 3       		# t2 = 3
j       raw

raw:
lw      t0, 0(t1)   		# t0 = x = 5
add     t1, t0, t2  		# t1 = t0 + t2

# lw instruction modifies t0 register,
# succeeding add instruction reads the data in t0 register.
# A data hazard occurs if the read takes place before the write operation is complete.
