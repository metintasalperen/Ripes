# Data Conflict (Hazard)
# "read after write (RAW)" or "true dependency":
# An instruction modifies a register or memory location, 
# and a succeeding instruction reads the data in that memory or register location.
# A data hazard occurs if the read takes place before the write operation is complete.

# Example:

.text
start:
li      t0, 5           # t0 = 5
li      t1, 3           # t1 = 3
li      t2, 0           # t2 = 0
li      t3, 2           # t3 = 2
j       raw             # branch unconditionally to raw

raw:
sub     t2, t0, t1      # t2 = t0 - t1
add     t4, t2, t3      # t4 = t2 + t3

# sub instruction modifies t2 register,
# succeeding add instruction reads the data in t2 register.
# A data hazard occurs if the read takes place before the write operation is complete.
